## üîπ Debugging Workflow

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| **1. Reproduce** | Make sure you can consistently reproduce the error. Document steps. |
| **2. Read Error Messages Carefully** | Copy console/log outputs, inspect stack traces, line numbers. |
| **3. Isolate** | Narrow down which file, function, or component is causing the problem. |
| **4. Inspect** | Use `console.log`, breakpoints, or debugging tools. Check variable values, state, API responses. |
| **5. Hypothesize** | Think about possible reasons why the error occurs. Compare with expected behavior. |
| **6. Test Fixes** | Apply small changes, re-test frequently. Avoid big changes at once. |
| **7. Verify** | Confirm the fix works in all edge cases and components are not broken. |
| **8. Document** | Write down the cause, fix, and key learning in your notes. |

## üîπ Pro Tips for Debugging Like an Industry Engineer

- **Reproduce consistently:** Only then can you fix reliably.  
- **Small changes first:** Change one thing at a time to see the effect.  
- **Use console & devtools:** `console.log`, Chrome/Edge devtools, React DevTools.  
- **Check dependencies & versions:** Mismatched libraries often cause subtle bugs.  
- **Read docs & error codes:** Most library/framework errors are documented.  
- **Ask targeted questions:** Provide error message, environment, and what you tried.  
- **Reflect:** Document how you solved the problem; this improves your debugging skill exponentially.
